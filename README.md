2. I used C++ for the csv program because I wanted to get more comfortable to use C++ with getting file . The calculator program I used HTML because it was simple to create and give it style i design. For the API I used JavaScript, similar with getting comfortable using the JS on API's . I'm learn a few on using js for more practice.
