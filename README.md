# CISC3160-LAB2

1. For CSV file progam I use C++, for the calculator it was done by doing HTML , and for the API using JavaScript .
2. I used C++ for the csv program because I wanted to get more comfortable to use C++ with getting file . The calculator program I used HTML because it was simple to create and give it style i design. For the API I used JavaScript, similar with getting comfortable using the JS on API's . I'm learn a few on using js for more practice. 
3. There was a different way to approch the problem by using java and css. 
4. If I was to solve the problems again I would have try working more with java on the calculator.I would like to approche the API problem using python and CSV I would have just use C++.
